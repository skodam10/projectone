							<h1>Lebron James</h1>
							<p> LeBron James will start at point guard
								for the Los Angeles Lakers next season,
								per Yahoo Sports, a head-scratching announcement
								for a player who has often served as the 
								de facto floor general for his team since entering the league in 2003.</p>

							<p>It is also not the first time he has 
								been slotted in at point guard. 
								In 2017, James recorded a triple-double as 
								Cleveland point guard and dropped 34 points with 
								13 assists in a different game against the Chicago Bulls in the same role.</p>
