							their revamped roster together on Saturday, agreeing 
							to a one-year deal with free-agent center 
							DeMarcus Cousins and bringing back point guard Rajon Rondo.</p>

							<p>Cousins, a four-time All-Star with the Sacramento Kings 
							and New Orleans Pelicans, signed a $5.3 million, 
							one-year deal with Golden State before the 2017-18 
							season and joined the Warriors in January after his
