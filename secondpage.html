							<h1>Anthony Davis</h1>
							<p> It took months to happen, but itâ€™s finally 
							happened. The New Orleans Pelicans have agreed 
							to a trade that will send superstar forward Anthony 
							Davis to the Los Angeles Lakers for a large haul of young assets.</p>

							<p>The Lakers went to extraordinary lengths to pair 
							James and Davis at Staples Center, and they 
							did that because the addition of Davis, who is 
							set to hit free agency next year, figures to turn them into 
							instant contenders.</p>
